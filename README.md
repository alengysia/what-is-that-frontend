# What IS that sound?

<p>What IS that sound is a website made for and devoted to exploring all the instruments that you may have heard but did not recognize. These instruments might be traditional to other countries, or even non traditional art installations. There are no rules as to what can or can't be added here, as long as it's an instrument that answers the main question: What IS that sound?</p>
